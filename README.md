# hankel-and-rationals
Hankel approximation using the matrix pencil method. Rational approximation using the same approach.

Approximate functions using decaying exponentials using the Matrix Pencil Method (MPM) and reduction algorithm from Beylkin Monzon 2005

There are currently two notebooks in this repo. One demonstrates the MPM using double precision. The other demonstrates the MPM using extended precision.
